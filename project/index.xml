Data Wrangling and Data Exploration  Introduction The two datasets that I chose are the college_recent_grads and college_grad_students sets from the fivethirtyeight package in R. The college_recent_grads dataset has information on recent graduates from a total of 173 different college majors with 21 variables. Examples of some of the variables are: how many individuals were in this major; the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile earnings; the unemployment rate; and the proportion of women who were in this major.</description>
